META-II for C
by Long Nguyen

This project is based on the paper META-II by Val Schorre from 1964.

META-II is written in itself so it needs to be bootstrapped from
a C implementation in bootstrap.c.

To build,

gcc -Wall -o bin/boot bootstrap.c
./bin/boot meta.txt bin/meta.c
gcc -Wall -o bin/meta bin/meta.c

The original version of META-II only allowed productions to emit
arbitrary text or the last recognized token. This version is
augmented with the ability to call arbitrary functions.
